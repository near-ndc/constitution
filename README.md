> *The NEAR Constitution V1 represents a first step towards defining a structure for future ecosystem-wide governance on NEAR.*
>
> *Below is a draft for review, consideration, comment, and refinement by the NEAR community.*

### *TL;DR*
*This first draft of the constitution is a minimum viable product for iterations into the future. The original vision proposed for the governance framework of the NDC was set by Illia during his ETH CC speech in Paris. From this speech, we have initiated the process of realizing that vision: Whereby the NEAR Digital Collective comprises a House of Merit, a Council of Advisors, a Transparency Commission, and a larger ecosystem-wide voting body. Together these institutions monitor the NEAR Treasury and create the early rails for Ecosystem wide governance.*

*As we ship this V1, it is expected that feedback and discussion will clearly delimit the following areas of these institutions in later versions: Election Process, Term, Powers, and Representation, Impeachment Procedure, and Constitutional Amendments over time.*

*We welcome feedback and suggestions from anyone and everyone - keeping in mind that we are following Illia’s original vision, and are on the clock to ship this as efficiently and thoroughly as possible!*

Each governing body is responsible for choosing its speaker and other officers.

#### Section 2: House of Merit (HOM)
The House of Merit (HOM) is composed of experienced and committed Community members chosen for a term by the Voting Body representative of the different ecosystem nodes.

No person can be a representative unless they have one year or greater of experience and active participation in the NEAR Ecosystem.

Every node in the NEAR Ecosystem is represented by at least one representative and may have additional representatives based on the impact of the node on the entire NEAR Ecosystem.

Representatives are appointed to ensure the interest of nodes during elections, allocation decisions, and budgeting cycles.

HOM members can be removed and disqualified from their roles

#### Section 5: Community Treasury
The House of Merit manages the Community Treasury with support from the Council of Advisors and checks from the Transparency Commission. Funds from the Community Treasury are to be deployed via an approved vote by the Voting Body to develop the NEAR Ecosystem.

To guarantee adequate management of the Treasury, the Governance Body is responsible for (1) Establishing safeguards against conflicts of interest, (2) providing a clear process such that the constitution and Governance Body can evolve over time (3) creating responsible Treasury management and risk mitigation, and (4) transparency of all operations. These four responsibilities are to be reflected in the operational structure of NEAR Ecosystem governance.

### Nodes
Nodes are the collectives within the NEAR Ecosystem that can be amended through an approved Referendum by the Voting Body. Today, nodes are defined as: Users, Contributors, Developers, Validators, Founders, NEAR Foundation, Pagoda, Partners, and Backers. Maintenance of Ecosystem Nodes is to be set by recurring voting procedures to ensure activity and engagement.

### Background
The NEAR Ecosystem has long requested and issued a call for a greater degree of transparency (openness) and self-governance. The call to action and assembly of the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC) is the collective NEAR Ecosystem (Ecosystem) response. The NDC is the “collective” representation of the NEAR Ecosystem (NEARVerse) as a governance node, represented and composed of nodes of users, contributors, validators, developers, projects, founders, partners, and backers. Collectively the NDC is focused on stewarding pragmatic decentralization that reflects and involves the full scope of our community.
